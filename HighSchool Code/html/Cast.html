    <div class="name">Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock / Venom:</div>
    <div class="details">An investigative journalist who becomes the host of an alien symbiote that imbues him with super-human abilities and a violent alter-ego: Venom. Director Ruben Fleischer said that unlike a werewolf or Jekyll and Hyde, the relationship between Brock and the symbiote is a "hybrid", with the two characters sharing a body and working together. Hardy was drawn to this duality, and compared the two characters to Ren and Stimpy. He gave each a distinctive voice: an "aw-shucks American accent" for Brock; and a "James Brown lounge lizard"-like voice for Venom, that was "modulated to sound more sinister". Hardy called Brock an antihero who would "do whatever he has to" to accomplish a goal. Hardy planned to use performance capture to portray Venom, but this idea was abandoned due to the difference between his face and the character's. </div>

    <p>Michelle Williams as Anne Weying:
        A district attorney and Eddie's ex-fiancée.[18][19] Williams was excited at the prospect of her character becoming She-Venom in the future, and Fleischer felt that it would be fun to give fans an Easter egg of this by briefly showing She-Venom in the film. This was kept a secret until the release of the film, and Flesicher hoped that the positive response to the appearance would lead to more She-Venom in future Venom films or even a standalone She-Venom film.[20]</p>

    <p>Riz Ahmed as Carlton Drake / Riot: 
A genius inventor and leader of the Life Foundation experimenting on the symbiotes.[12][13] Ahmed explained that Drake is trying to save the future of humanity when he discovers the symbiote,[13] with Fleischer adding that Drake has a positive goal but a "moral ambiguity" that leads to him testing his science on other people.[20] Drake is eventually bonded to another symbiote known as Riot, which Fleischer described as "a body-hopper".[13]</p>

Additionally, Jenny Slate and Melora Walters respectively portray Dora Skirth, a Life Foundation scientist,[23] and Maria, a homeless woman that Brock befriends.[24] Chris O’Hara has a brief appearance as astronaut John Jameson.[25] Woody Harrelson is introduced in the film's mid-credits scene as Cletus Kasady,[26] while Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a dog-walker who talks to Brock and Venom.[27] Sope Aluko,[21] Scott Deckert,[28] Marcella Bragio, Michelle Lee, Mac Brandt, Christian Convery, Sam Medina,[29] and Ron Cephas Jones also appear in the film.[30]</p>
