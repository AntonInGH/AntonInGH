Unlike any other car, the Regera can actually go from 0 to 250 mph using just one gear. That's right, it doesn't matter if the driver is cruising through city streets at 20 mph, or blasting down the Autobahn with the gas pedal buried in the carpet at 250 mph, he'll still be in the same gear.</p></td>

Only 63 units of the coupe and 19 roadsters were made, making the Sian one of the rarest cars to don the raging bull brand logo. This supercar is not cheap, nor can it be accused of being moderate, seeing as it comes with a monster V12 engine and a supercapacitor!</p>

        <p>At the time, it was the most powerful Lamborghini ever produced, which was clearly reflected in its price tag. Priced at nearly $4 million, and with a top speed of around 217 mph, this is not the kind of car we expect to see regularly on the road.</p></td>

        <td><p>The <b><i>Pagani Huayra</i></b> was faster than a thunderbolt from the gods, and the Pagani Huayra BC Roadster is a variant with even more power and sweet modifications. It is lighter than the standard Huayra and has a removable top. Just like all the other Huayras, the Roadster BC is powered by a twin-turbo, 6.0-liter, AMG-sourced V12 engine. However, the engine has been tuned specifically for the Roadster BC, though, which means it now produces 791 horsepower and 774 lb-ft of torque, all of which is sent exclusively to the rear wheels via a 7-speed sequential manual transmission.</p></td>

        <td><p>The <b><i>McLaren Speedtail</i></b> is built for one purpose only — to take up to three people from point A to point B faster than anything else this side of a private jet! This hypercar has more than a thousand horsepower and reaches a top speed of 250 mph. The McLaren Speedtail features a 4.0-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 engine with a parallel hybrid system. The gasoline engine produces 1,035 hp, and the electric motor produces another 310 hp, for a total of 1,345 wild horses. All this power means it can go from zero to 186 mph in 12.8 seconds, which is faster than the average grocery getter manages to reach 60 mph. This is a very limited production vehicle, with only 106 examples seeing the light of the day.</p></td>

        <td><p>Valkyries were said to show Viking warriors into Valhalla, which is rather fitting as the <b><i>Aston Martin Valkyrie</i></b> effectively shows drivers a gateway to insane amounts of power, speed, and pleasure! The Aston Martin Valkyrie has a distinct look and a whopping 1,160 horses on tap, with the power coming from a 6.5-liter V12. While it may sound like a cliché, this car actually is a close to a street-legal Formula 1 racer as it's possible to get, and that a stunning accomplishment that can go fast enough to satisfy even the biggest need for speed.</p></td>

However, the <b><i>Hennessey Venom F5</i></b> isn't the first supercar built by the legendary Texas-based car tuning company, previously, they've created the Hennessey Venom GT, which proved to be faster than a Bugatti Veyron. Now, they've built the Venom F5 from scratch to be one of the fastest, if not the fastest car ever.</p></td>

This is a track-focused beast that offers extreme performance, in fact, we're pretty sure it is capable of turning time and space into a blur!</p> <p>The Absolut uses a 5.0-liter engine that produces a rather impressive 1,603 horsepower. Like all the best supercars, it has a rear-mid-engine configuration and rear-wheel-drive. Koenigsegg says the Jesko Absolut can reach 330 mph. We choose to believe them... absolutely.</p></td>

        <td><p>From 2004 to 2013, SSC North America produced the <b><i>SSC Aero</i></b>, a car so fast it actually beat the "regular" Bugatti Veyron, making it the world's fastest production car with a two-way maximum speed of 257.41 mph. The SSC Tuatara has some big shoes to fill then, but seeing as it has a top speed of more than 300 mph, we're sure it'll live up to expectations.To achieve such ludicrous speeds, the Tuatara, like any self-respecting hypercar, has a monster of an engine. This one produces up to 1,750 horses depending on the fuel used. This car is an absolute dream, with mean lines and an aggressive stance.</p></td>

It is a beast, a very raw and frightfully aggressive one, that aims to break every boundary and redefine every concept.The Bolide is designed to be the fastest and most uncompromising automobile from Bugatti, that's why it packs an 8.0-liter W16 engine that’s capable of unleashing 1,825 horsepower and 1,364 pound-feet of torque.
